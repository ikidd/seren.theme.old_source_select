# seren.theme.old_source_select

This theme simply restores the old look for Source Select from pre-2.0.  All other theme settings are as default from Seren Fox.

Download this theme as a zip.  Go into Seren Settings and under Interface, scroll down to Install Theme.  

Add it there either by browsing the zip file you downloaded or browsing to this address: https://www.github.com/ikidd/seren.theme.old_source_select/zipball.main

Note: some strings are hardcoded to their English values as there aren't any equivalent string values to allow translation in the new Seren version.  A PR has been added and I might be able to update this with corrected values if it's accepted.
